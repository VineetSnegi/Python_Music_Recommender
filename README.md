# Music Recommendation System

This project creates Music Recommendation Engine in Python using Spotify API and machine learning.


## Overview

Music recommendation systems are currently a popular type of recommendation system that is used to suggest songs or playlists to users based on either listening history or certain preferences.
Spotify is among the popular music streaming platforms. It contains a vast amount of data that can be utilized to build a recommendation system.

The system allows users to input songs they like, and receives recommended tracks based on playlist and preferences.
User can also find the info of their favourite artist.

The recommendations are powered by Spotify's API and recommendation algorithms. User authorization with Spotify is handled via OAuth 2.0.
